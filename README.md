# TRAECNclaw MCP Skill

> Generated from canonical TRAECNclaw 0.5.6 at commit `0fde120d5c2ac848ef61f14b7d3faf1e44c74894`.

This repository mirrors the portable TRAECNclaw Agent Skill byte-for-byte.
TRAECNclaw exposes MCP contract version 5 with exactly 20 stable, single-intent
tools. The normal Agent flow is:

1. Open a workspace only when needed.
2. Select model or mode only when needed.
3. Send one message and release the caller context.
4. Legacy MCP clients receive a durable notification; modern `2026-07-28`
   hosts can negotiate Tasks and subscribe to the exact returned task ID.

Queueing, waiting, recovery, routine non-command questions, task ownership, and durable
notifications remain gateway-managed.

The local server uses standard newline-delimited stdio, implements MCP
`2026-07-28`, and remains compatible with initialization-based `2025-11-25`
and `2024-11-05` clients. TRAECNclaw contract version 5 is the tool-surface
version, not the MCP protocol revision. The independently negotiated,
upstream-draft `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` extension does not add tools.

## Install

Use the canonical [TRAECNclaw release](https://github.com/Luckycat133/TRAECNclaw/releases)
or a source checkout. Install the matching complete server archive, copy
`.codex/skills/traecnclaw-mcp` into the client's Skill directory, and use its
`assets/mcp-client-config.json` launcher template. The launcher resolves an
explicit server path, repository checkout, installed package, or
`traecnclaw-mcp` executable on `PATH`, in that order.

The mirror does not advertise an npm or official MCP Registry version until
that exact artifact has been published and verified. Smithery's retired
`smithery.yaml` format is intentionally absent; a future Smithery listing must
use a published MCPB bundle. `glama.json` remains the current Glama metadata.

## Configuration

The canonical gateway defaults are `TRAECN_GATEWAY_HOST=127.0.0.1` and
`TRAECN_GATEWAY_PORT=8788`. Non-loopback binds require
`TRAECN_GATEWAY_TOKEN`. There is no MCP tool-profile setting.

See `SOURCE_REVISION` and `release-manifest.json` for provenance and
marketplace readiness.

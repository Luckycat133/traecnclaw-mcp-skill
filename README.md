# TRAECNclaw MCP Skill

> Generated from canonical TRAECNclaw 0.5.0 at commit `5bf61db3c06a3616c772e09d058e4ea1a01e2d72`.

This repository mirrors the portable TRAECNclaw Agent Skill byte-for-byte.
TRAECNclaw exposes MCP contract version 5 with exactly 20 stable, single-intent
tools. The normal Agent flow is:

1. Open a workspace only when needed.
2. Select model or mode only when needed.
3. Send one message and release the caller context.
4. Receive the durable notification, then read the task only when the result is needed.

Queueing, waiting, recovery, routine approvals, task ownership, and durable
notifications remain gateway-managed.

## Install

Use the canonical [TRAECNclaw release](https://github.com/Luckycat133/TRAECNclaw/releases)
or a source checkout. Copy `.codex/skills/traecnclaw-mcp` into the client's
Skill directory and use its `assets/mcp-client-config.json` launcher template.

The mirror does not advertise an npm or official MCP Registry version until
that exact artifact has been published and verified. Smithery's retired
`smithery.yaml` format is intentionally absent; a future Smithery listing must
use a published MCPB bundle. `glama.json` remains the current Glama metadata.

## Configuration

The canonical gateway defaults are `TRAECN_GATEWAY_HOST=127.0.0.1` and
`TRAECN_GATEWAY_PORT=8788`. Non-loopback binds require
`TRAECN_GATEWAY_TOKEN`. There is no MCP tool-profile setting.

See `SOURCE_REVISION` and `release-manifest.json` for provenance and
marketplace readiness.

# TRAECNclaw MCP Skill

> Generated from canonical TRAECNclaw 0.5.8 at commit `c8d492d2e5eba28a209c68b14e280cf0cbdfac39`.

TRAECNclaw is a local-first MCP server and Agent Skill for operating the TraeCN
desktop app on the user's Mac. This repository is the public distribution
mirror: it carries the portable Skill, installable server archives, provenance,
and marketplace metadata without publishing the private canonical history.

TRAECNclaw exposes MCP contract version 5 with exactly 20 stable,
single-intent tools. The normal Agent flow is:

1. Open a workspace only when needed.
2. Select model or mode only when needed.
3. Send one message and release the caller context.
4. Legacy MCP clients receive a durable notification; modern `2026-07-28`
   hosts can negotiate Tasks and subscribe to the exact returned task ID.

Queueing, waiting, recovery, routine non-command questions, task ownership, and
durable completion remain gateway-managed.

The local server uses newline-delimited stdio, implements MCP `2026-07-28`, and
remains compatible with initialization-based `2025-11-25` and `2024-11-05`
clients. TRAECNclaw contract version 5 is the tool-surface version, not the MCP
protocol revision. The independently negotiated, upstream-draft
`io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` extension does not add tools.

## Install the server

Use this repository's matching [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Luckycat133/traecnclaw-mcp-skill/releases)
for the complete server archive. Install the exact archive version before
configuring a host; do not use the unrelated historical npm 0.3.1 package as a
current server.

## Install the Agent Skill

Install from the public GitHub repository with the open Skills CLI:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/Luckycat133/traecnclaw-mcp-skill \
  --skill traecnclaw-mcp \
  -g
```

Or download the matching Skill archive from the GitHub Release. The Skill lives
at `.codex/skills/traecnclaw-mcp` and includes
`assets/mcp-client-config.json`, `scripts/setup-mcp.js`, and the server launcher.
Restart the Agent host after installing or updating the Skill.

Use `scripts/setup-mcp.js` to validate server discovery and generate the host
entry. The normal runtime is:

```text
Agent host -> local stdio server -> gateway on the same Mac -> TraeCN
```

The server and gateway run on the same user-owned Mac as TraeCN. Marketplace
containers may inspect the stdio schema, but a cloud container cannot
transparently control the user's local TraeCN desktop.

The mirror does not advertise an npm or Official MCP Registry version until
that exact artifact has been published and verified. Smithery local publication
will use a verified MCPB bundle; the retired `smithery.yaml` format remains
absent.

## Configuration

The gateway defaults are `TRAECN_GATEWAY_HOST=127.0.0.1` and
`TRAECN_GATEWAY_PORT=8788`. Non-loopback binds require
`TRAECN_GATEWAY_TOKEN`. There is no MCP tool-profile setting.

## Discovery channels

The same public repository is the canonical source for Skill and MCP directory
submissions. A directory listing is trustworthy only when its version, local
stdio transport, macOS requirement, 20-tool count, and generated install command
match this Release.

Selected channels include ClawHub, Glama, skills.sh, AwesomeSkills.dev,
MCP.Directory, MCPB/Smithery Local, and—after a current public package exists—the
Official MCP Registry and PulseMCP. Other directories should reuse the same
provenance and install copy rather than maintaining forks.

## Glama

`glama.json` and the generated root Dockerfile support directory registration,
maintainer verification, security/quality scanning, and tool-schema inspection.
The Dockerfile installs the current public Release and never contains a gateway
token or mock bridge.

TRAECNclaw should be listed as a **local stdio server**. Do not describe a Glama
hosted container as an automatic remote connection to the user's Mac.

See `SOURCE_REVISION` and `release-manifest.json` for provenance and channel
readiness.

# TRAECNclaw MCP Skill

> Generated from canonical TRAECNclaw 0.6.0 at commit `40bcf7707ed9b0ff7938aea8e511d0b87d300705`.

TRAECNclaw is a local-first MCP server and Agent Skill for operating the TraeCN
desktop app on the user's Mac. This repository is the public distribution
mirror: it carries the portable Skill, installable server archives, provenance,
and marketplace metadata without publishing the private canonical history.

TRAECNclaw exposes MCP contract version 5 with exactly 20 stable,
single-intent tools. The normal Agent flow is:

1. Open a workspace only when needed.
2. Select model or mode only when needed.
3. Send one message and release the caller context.
4. Legacy MCP clients receive a durable notification; modern `2026-07-28`
   hosts can negotiate Tasks and subscribe to the exact returned task ID.

Queueing, waiting, recovery, routine non-command questions, task ownership, and
durable completion remain gateway-managed.

The local server uses newline-delimited stdio, implements MCP `2026-07-28`, and
remains compatible with initialization-based `2025-11-25` and `2024-11-05`
clients. TRAECNclaw contract version 5 is the tool-surface version, not the MCP
protocol revision. The independently negotiated, upstream-draft
`io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` extension does not add tools.

## Install the server

Install the exact release through one verified channel:

```sh
npm install --global @luckycat133/traecnclaw@0.6.0
# or, after `brew info` reports 0.6.0
brew install Luckycat133/tap/traecnclaw
```

The matching [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Luckycat133/traecnclaw-mcp-skill/releases/tag/v0.6.0)
also provides the complete scoped npm tarball and deterministic MCPB bundle.
The unrelated unscoped `traecnclaw@0.3.1` package is historical and is not a
current install path.

## Install the Agent Skill

Install from the public GitHub repository with the open Skills CLI:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/Luckycat133/traecnclaw-mcp-skill \
  --skill traecnclaw-mcp \
  -g
```

Or download the matching Skill archive from the GitHub Release. The Skill lives
at `.codex/skills/traecnclaw-mcp` and includes
`assets/mcp-client-config.json`, `scripts/setup-mcp.js`, and the server launcher.
Restart the Agent host after installing or updating the Skill.

Use `scripts/setup-mcp.js` to validate server discovery and generate the host
entry. The normal runtime is:

```text
Agent host -> local stdio server -> gateway on the same Mac -> TraeCN
```

The server and gateway run on the same user-owned Mac as TraeCN. Marketplace
containers may inspect the stdio schema, but a cloud container cannot
transparently control the user's local TraeCN desktop.

Prepared Official Registry metadata uses the scoped package
`@luckycat133/traecnclaw@0.6.0` with local stdio transport. Smithery Local
uses the matching verified MCPB bundle; the retired `smithery.yaml` format
remains absent.

## Configuration

The gateway defaults are `TRAECN_GATEWAY_HOST=127.0.0.1` and
`TRAECN_GATEWAY_PORT=8788`. Non-loopback binds require
`TRAECN_GATEWAY_TOKEN`. There is no MCP tool-profile setting.

## Discovery channels

The same public repository is the canonical source for Skill and MCP directory
submissions. A directory listing is trustworthy only when its version, local
stdio transport, macOS requirement, 20-tool count, and generated install command
match this Release.

Selected channels include ClawHub, Glama, skills.sh, AwesomeSkills.dev,
MCP.Directory, MCPB/Smithery Local, and—after a current public package exists—the
Official MCP Registry and PulseMCP. Other directories should reuse the same
provenance and install copy rather than maintaining forks.

## Glama

`glama.json` and the generated root Dockerfile support directory registration,
maintainer verification, security/quality scanning, and tool-schema inspection.
The Dockerfile installs the current public Release and never contains a gateway
token or mock bridge.

TRAECNclaw should be listed as a **local stdio server**. Do not describe a Glama
hosted container as an automatic remote connection to the user's Mac.

See `SOURCE_REVISION` and `release-manifest.json` for provenance and channel
readiness.
